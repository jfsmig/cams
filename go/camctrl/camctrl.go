// Package camctrl is the controller of a camera agent: the client structure
// through which the rest of the process drives one camera.
//
// The package also owns the vocabulary the two sides exchange. It has to live
// on this side of the seam rather than in the agent, because everything that
// holds a controller would otherwise pull the agent in transitively, and
// keeping the agent out of every package but the process entry point is the
// whole point of the split. The framing underneath belongs to agentbus.
