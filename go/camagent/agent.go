// Package camagent is the agent in charge of one camera: it discovers the
// media stream over ONVIF, negotiates it over RTSP, and relays the raw RTP and
// RTCP packets to an upstream.
//
// It is driven only through the message bus, by a camctrl.Client. Nothing but
// the process entry point should import this package: everything else holds a
// controller instead.
